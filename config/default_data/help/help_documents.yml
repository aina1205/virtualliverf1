    - "h1. Minimum Metadata Guidelines for the SysMO SEEK\r\n\
      \r\n\
      The more metadata you provide for your assets in the SEEK, the easier it is to find them and to compare them with other assets. If you provide assets with very little metadata, these will also be displayed (in accordance with access control policies set by you), but they may be hard to interpret for other people.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      In addition to SEEK data sharing guidelines, some types of data have minimum metadata requirements for publication, for example, microarray data must be MIAME compliant. Following the guidelines for SEEK metadata should ensure that when you come to publish, you have already met these requirements. \r\n\
      These guidelines outline what we require for SEEK.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      h2. General SEEK Metadata\r\n\
      \r\n\
      *Name* (of the data uploader). This is the person responsible for the data and responsible for setting sharing and dissemination policies. If more than one person was involved in the experiment, you can credit these people separately \r\n\
      *SEEK ID* \xE2\x80\x93 (Of the above person). This helps us identify each person within SEEK. \r\n\
      *Project* \xE2\x80\x93 The name of the project that the asset relates to. If your data is being uploaded by a JERM harvester, we will know which project it belongs to, but if you are uploading directly to SEEK and you are in more than one SysMO project, it is important to specify. Typically, an asset will belong to only one project.\r\n\
      *Upload Date (yymmdd)*. This is the date of publication to SEEK rather than the date of the experiment. Depending on the system your project uses, we will try to automatically detect when changes are made to a file. Each upload will automatically receive its own timestamp when uploaded directly into SEEK\r\n\
      *Experiment Date (yymmdd)*. This is the date the experiment was performed\r\n\
      *Title* \xE2\x80\x93 a unique name for your asset file. If you upload manually, you will receive an error message if the file title is not unique within your project. If your asset is uploaded via a JERM Harvester without a title, you will receive an email notification.\r\n\
      *Version Number* \xE2\x80\x93 If your file replaces an existing file, the version number will help us pick this up. Keep it simple, versions should go up by integers.\r\n\
      *Names of other people involved* \xE2\x80\x93 many experiments involve multiple steps and multiple people. This metadata field allows you to give credit and attribution to all those involved\r\n\

    - "h1. Transcriptomics: Guidelines for SysMO Templates\r\n\
      \r\n\
      The MIAME standard and the associated MAGE-ML format are well established in the transcriptomics community and adherence to MAGE-ML is becoming increasingly important for publishing data. \r\n\
      \r\n\
      MAGE-TAB is a tab delimited representation of MAGE-ML. It allows users to construct MIAME compliant excel spreadsheets. The ISA-TAB specification also allows an export to MAGE-TAB format.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      For SysMO-DB, we recommend you use MAGE-TAB templates for transcriptomics data. We have a JERM mapping for MAGE-TAB, so as long as you do not change the headers and titles of worksheets, we can extract your data in this format.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      There are several parts to a MAGE-TAB file. These parts can be represented as separate files, or separate worksheets in excel. MAGE-TAB consists of:\r\n\
      \r\n\
      *IDF \xE2\x80\x93 Investigation Description Format*\r\n\
      This worksheet is an overview of the experiment, factors studied, protocols, publication information and contact details.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      *SDRF \xE2\x80\x93 Sample and Data Relationship Format*\r\n\
      This worksheet details the links between sample and data, it can include information about the source (e.g. organism rat), the sample (e.g. rat liver), extracts (e.g. total RNA), labelled extract (e.g. synthetic DNA), hybridisations (e.g. a reference on the Array as defined by the ADF), raw data (e.g. a reference to a raw data file), normalisation (e.g. a reference to normalised data file), derived array data files (e.g. a reference to a derived data file, or file matrix)\r\n\
      \r\n\
      *Raw Data and Processed Data*\r\n\
      These worksheets hold the actual and derived data values\r\n\
      \r\n\
      *ADF \xE2\x80\x93 Array Design Format (optional)*\r\n\
      This worksheet provides the array-level annotation for the experiment, relating the row-level identifiers in the data files to biological sequence annotation.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      There are a detailed \"set of help pages and examples provided by the MGED community\":http://tab2mage.sourceforge.net/docs/magetab_docs.html\r\n\
      \r\n\
      There are also tools to help you construct MAGE-TAB templates on the web. For example, there is the \"ArrayExpress submission help system\":http://www.ebi.ac.uk/cgi-bin/microarray/magetab.cgi and there is the \"ISA curator tool from the ISA-TAB group\":http://isatab.sourceforge.net/isacreator.html\r\n\
      \r\n\
      h2. Notes and additions for SysMO\r\n\
      \r\n\
      h3. IDF\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Many of the personal details in the IDF sheet can be automatically extracted from your SysMO SEEK profile. If you add your SEEK ID as an additional field (called SEEK ID), we can extract all your personal details from your profile so there is no need to complete these personal details fields. \r\n\
      Similarly, you can refer to protocols (SOPs in SEEK) by their SEEK ID, and we can automatically extract their name and brief description.\r\n\
      This worksheet also contains fields to link to publications. In many cases, data could be shared in SEEK before publication. If so, please leave these fields blank, but do not remove them.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      h3. SDRF\r\n\
      \r\n\
      This file links the sample and source information to the data files and their locations.\r\n\
      The \xE2\x80\x9Cprotocol\xE2\x80\x9D columns will normally be followed by \xE2\x80\x9Cfactor value\xE2\x80\x9D columns. Again, we can extract these from the experimental conditions and factors studies sections of SEEK where you are referring to a SOP already submitted. \r\n\
      \r\n\
      \r\n\
      h3. Raw Data and Processed Data\r\n\
      \r\n\
      h5. Raw Data\r\n\
      \r\n\
      We do not necessarily expect you to share raw data within SEEK by default, but links to this upon request are essential. The MAGE-TAB specification supports many different types of raw data format. For a complete list, please see \"here\":http://tab2mage.sourceforge.net/docs/datafiles.html\r\n\
      \r\n\
      h5. Processed Data\r\n\
      \r\n\
      If your processed data maps to the identifier in your array design, you can create a single results file with column 1 being those identifiers with the heading \xE2\x80\x9CReporter Identifier\xE2\x80\x9D followed by the quantitation columns with the quantitation types as the headings and the column of data values. Additionally, you may want to add columns for a name and/or description of identifier, but this is optional\r\n\
      \r\n\
      \r\n\
      h3. ADF\r\n\
      \r\n\
      This worksheet is necessary when submitting your array data to a public repository, but it is optional for SEEK. It is a physical description of the array. Many commercial and academic array designs have already been submitted to ArrayExpress, so you could simply reference your design from ArrayExpress. Affymetrix, Agilent, Illumina, Nimblegen and Sanger array designs have already been submitted and can be explored \"here\":http://www.ebi.ac.uk/microarray-as/aer/entry\r\n"

    - Frequently Asked Questions
    - "h6. What is the SysMO-SEEK? \r\n\
      \r\n\
      The SEEK is a catalogue of assets held by the SysMO consortium. You can use the SEEK searching interface to find Data, Models, SOPs and protocols. You can also use it to find people, their institutions and their expertise\r\n\
      \r\n\
      \r\n\
      h6. What is the Yellow Page?\r\n\
      \r\n\
      A directory of all the current and past members of the SysMO consortium, their project associates, their institutions and their expertise and experience\r\n\
      \r\n\
      \r\n\
      h6. Are the SysMO Assets (Data, Models, and SOPs) kept in SEEK?\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Not normally. SEEK links to the repositories of each SysMO project, so it is a catalogue of what is available rather than a repository. You can, however, upload files if you wish.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      \r\n\
      h6. What kind of models can I store/link to?\r\n\
      \r\n\
      SEEK can handle models in any format, but we recommend that you use SBML. JWS Online simulations can also be run from SEEK for models in SBML\r\n\
      \r\n\
      \r\n\
      h6. What format should SOPs be in?\r\n\
      \r\n\
      You can upload SOPs in any format, but we recommend you use the \xE2\x80\x9CNature Protocols\xE2\x80\x9D format. A template is available for download from SEEK. In the future, we will be able to extract extra information from this format to help with the searching\r\n\
      \r\n\
      \r\n\
      h6. Can I delete things from SEEK?\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Yes, you can delete any assets owned by you (i.e. any items that show you as the uploader). If they are associated with other assets, you will first have to remove the associations, otherwise the asset won\xE2\x80\x99t be properly deleted, but deprecated.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      \r\n\
      h6. What is the Investigations Tab for?\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Investigations are high level descriptions of the research carried out by a particular SysMO project. They typically reflect the general aims of the project, for example, carbon metabolism or anaerobic/aerobic transitions.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      \r\n\
      h6. What is the Studies Tab for?\r\n\
      \r\n\
      A study is a series of experiments (or assays) which can be combined to answer a particular biological question. These experiments might be a series of the same type of assay (for example, microarrays for different conditions), or they may be a collection of different types of assay (e.g. a combination of array and mass spec measurements).\r\n\
      \r\n\
      \r\n\
      h6. What is the assay Tab for?\r\n\
      \r\n\
      An assay describes a particular experiment. It allows you to associate data files, SOPs and models together as well as describing the type of assay and any technology required to perform the experiment.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      \r\n\
      h6. Can I change or add information to SEEK assets after they are uploaded?\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Yes, if you have permission, you can edit any asset. You will automatically have permission to change anything you own and other people in your project might also give you permission to edit their assets. \r\n\
      \r\n\
      h6. Can I see all the assets on SEEK?\r\n\
      \r\n\
      No. All assets can be shared with specific individuals or groups, so some things will be not be public and hidden from view. In some cases, you might be able to see a description of an asset (the asset metadata), but not be able to download it. In these situations, you will be able to send a request to the owner to ask for their permission to download the asset.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      \r\n\
      h6. What is metadata?\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Metadata is a description of the data and where it originates (it is data about the data). For example, metadata about a model would include; who produced it, what project was it associated with, what format it was in, what type of model etc."

      h1. Proteomics: Suggestions for SysMO Templates
      
      The MIAPE standard (Minimum Information About a Proteomics Experiment) follows the same principles as the longer established MIAME standard for transcriptomics. It is a set of guidelines describing the minimum information required to adequately record a proteomics experiment (i.e. where the samples came from, how they were analysed and what equipment was used etc) to allow others to understand and potentially reuse data.
      
      There is growing interest in the MIAPE standard from publishers, and some journals now require MAIPE compliant data in order to publish. This is not yet as widespread as the requirement for MIAME compliance in transcriptomics, but it is still increasing.
      
      For SysMO-SEEK, we recommend you adopt a MIAPE compliant data template where possible.
      
      Proteomics experiments vary widely and cover many different techniques. MIAPE is therefore a collection of reporting guidelines for the different technologies available. Examples include:
      
      * Reporting guidelines for molecular interaction experiments (MIMIx)
      * Reporting guidelines for Mass Spectrometry experiments
      * Reporting guidelines for Mass Spectrometry Informatics experiments
      * Reporting guidelines for Gel Electrophoresis experiments
      * Reporting guidelines for Column Chromatography
      * Reporting guidelines for Capillary Electrophoresis
      * Reporting guidelines for gel image informatics (under development)
      
      The associated examples are templates for Mass Spectrometry experiments. These have been developed by the Pride PRoteomics IDEntifications database and more details can be found on "their website":http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/
      
      Embedded in the spreadsheet are some macros that will help you annotate your data with terms from controlled vocabularies where appropriate.
