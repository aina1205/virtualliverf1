= Bioportal Plugin Documentation


A plugin that supports linking of Models within a RoR application to a Concept and Ontology within the BioPortal

Also includes a Mixin and a Helper to facilitate making use of the Rest API without linking to a Model.

More information about BioPortal, and its Rest API, may be found at:

http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ (main Portal)

http://www.bioontology.org/wiki/index.php/BioPortal_REST_services (Rest services).

= Getting started

== Installing the plugin

Download the plugin from /xxx/ (needs to be hosted seperate from SysMO)

Generate the database migration by running

./script/generate bioportal_migration

This generates a table that maps to the BioportalConcept entity, though you don't need to know about this in your application.

== Usage

=== Linking to a Model

To link to a model in your RoR application, add the following line to your Model class

class MyThing < ActiveRecord::Base
  linked_to_bioportal :email=>"fred.bloggs@email.com"
...
end

adding :email is optional, but recommended as you will be notified of changes to the REST API.

You can also use :base_url to indicate a different deployment of BioPortal than the default, which is http://rest.bioontology.org/bioportal/

This then provides your model with the attributes:

ontology_id
ontology_version_id
concept_uri

which once set allows you to call the method concept to retreive information about that concept, such as its synonyms, parents and children.

and you can also call the method 'ontology' to reteive information about the ontology.

More information about this can be found in the API documentation.

=== Using the REST API stand-alone

by adding the include

include BioPortal::RestAPI

you can include integration with the BioPortal within your controllers or helpers.

This currently provides the facilities:

get_concept

search

get_ontology_details

get_ontology_versions

get_concepts_for_ontology_version_id

=== View Helpers

Some view helpers are automatically injected into your application and currently provided helpers for

link_to_concept_id 

link_to_ontology

link_to_ontology_version

link_to_ontology_version_visualize

link_to_download_ontology

bioportal_form_complete
