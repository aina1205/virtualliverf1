= Upgrading SEEK

This guide assumes that SEEK has been installed following the INSTALL[link:files/doc/INSTALL.html] guide. It assumes it is
a production server that is being updated, and that commands are run from the root directory of the SEEK application.

== Backing up

<b>You should always backup before starting to upgrade !!</b>
There are 2 things you need to backup - the database and filestore.

=== Backing up the database

You can backup the database using <em>mysqldump</em> using the following syntax. The database name, username and password
follows that which was used in the install guide - however the username and password should be different for you if you'd
changed them as suggested.

  mysqldump -umysqluser -pmysqlpassword seek_production > seek_production.sql

=== Backing up files

All assets are stored in the directory filestore/ and this should be backed up to another location. The upgrade process
would never normally touch these files, but always better to be safe than sorry.

=== Restoring

Should you ever need to restore the database you can do so by logging into mysql

  mysql -umysqluser -pmysqlpassword

and creating the database (assuming it no longer exists), connecting to it, and importing the dump:

  >create database seek_production;
  >\r seek_production
  >\. ./seek_production.sql

The files can be restored simply by copying the folder back over to filestore/

== Identifying your version

You can tell which version you have installed by looking at the config/version.yml file, so for example version 0.13.1
looks something like:

  major: 0
  minor: 13
  patch: 1

== Upgrading between versions

<b>If upgrading from a version earlier than v0.11.x please contact our GoogleGroup at http://groups.google.com/group/seek-development</b>

When upgrading between versions greater than v0.11.x you need to upgrade to each released version in order incrementally. The released versions are listed below:

* 0.11.x
* 0.13.1

<em>(Note there was no 0.12.x version released, this was an internal release)</em>

Each version has a tag in mercurial that is the version preceeded by a <em>v</em> - e.g. v0.11.1, v0.13.1

When upgrading between minor versions (i.e. from 0.11.x to 0.13.x) it is necessary to run a seek:upgrade rake task to perform
upgrade changes and import any new data. The upgrade task may require an internet connection, and sometimes can take some time to run,
so please be patient.

When upgrading between patch versions (i.e between 0.13.0 and 0.13.1) it should
only be necessary to a db:migrate rake task. Using seek:upgrade should still work, but could take a lot of unnecessary time.

== Steps to upgrade from 0.11.x to 0.13.x

There follows the commands required to upgrade. Anything after # are notes and do not need to be included in the command run.

    rake solr:stop RAILS_ENV=production # this is specific to this upgrade, since the command to stop and start the search has changed.
    hg pull https://sysmo-db.googlecode.com/hg/ -r v0.13.1
    hg update
    hg merge # only required if you've made changes since installing. If you have you may need to deal with conflicts.
    hg commit -m "merged" # likewise - only required if you made changes since installing
    bundle install --deployment
    rake seek:upgrade
    rake sunspot:solr:start RAILS_ENV=production # to restart the search server
    rake sunspot:solr:reindex RAILS_ENV=production  # to reindex
    rake tmp:assets:clear RAILS_ENV=production
    rake tmp:clear RAILS_ENV=production

SEEK v0.13.1 and beyond now uses a Ruby tool called {Delayed Job}[https://github.com/tobi/delayed_job] to handle background processing
which now needs to be started using:

    RAILS_ENV=production ./script/delayed_job start

And now SEEK should be ready to restart. If running together with Passenger Phusion as described in the install guide
this is simply a case of:

   touch tmp/restart.txt
