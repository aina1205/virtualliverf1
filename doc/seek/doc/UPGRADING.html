<h1 id="label-Upgrading+SEEK">Upgrading SEEK</h1>

<p><strong>Always backup your SEEK data before starting to upgrade!!</strong>
- see the <a href="../files/doc/BACKUPS.html">Backup Guide</a>.</p>

<p>This guide assumes that SEEK has been installed following the <a
href="../files/doc/INSTALL.html">Installation Guide</a> guide. It assumes
it is a production server that is being updated, and that commands are run
from the root directory of the SEEK application.</p>

<p>If your current installation is not linked to to the SEEK GoogleCode
mercurial repository, it can still easily be updated by taking the next
stable tag, reconfiguring the database configuration to point at your
existing database, and copying across the <em>filestore/</em> directory.
The upgrade steps can then be followed, with the Mercurial (hg) steps
omitted.</p>

<h2 id="label-Identifying+your+version">Identifying your version</h2>

<p>You can tell which version you have installed by looking at the
<em>config/version.yml</em> file, so for example version 0.13.2 looks
something like:</p>

<pre>major: 0
minor: 13
patch: 2</pre>

<h2 id="label-General+notes+about+versions+and+upgrading">General notes about versions and upgrading</h2>

<p><strong>If upgrading from a version earlier than v0.11.x please contact our
GoogleGroup at <a
href="http://groups.google.com/group/seek-development">groups.google.com/group/seek-development</a></strong></p>

<p>When upgrading between versions greater than v0.11.x you need to upgrade to
each released minor version in order incrementally (i.e. 0.13.2-&gt;0.14.0,
you can skip patch versions such as 0.13.3). The released versions are
listed below:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>0.11.x</p>
</li><li>
<p>0.13.2</p>
</li><li>
<p>0.13.3</p>
</li><li>
<p>0.14.0</p>
</li><li>
<p>0.14.1</p>
</li><li>
<p>0.15.0</p>
</li></ul>

<p><em>(Note there was no 0.12.x version released externally, this was an
internal release)</em></p>

<p>Each version has a tag in mercurial that is the version preceeded by a
<em>v</em> - e.g. v0.11.1, v0.13.2, v0.14.0</p>

<p>When upgrading between minor versions (i.e. from 0.11.x to 0.13.x) it is
necessary to run a seek:upgrade rake task to perform upgrade changes and
import any new data. The upgrade task may require an internet connection,
and sometimes can take some time to run, so please be patient. There are
instructions for upgrading between each minor version listed below, but
they will generally follow the same pattern.</p>

<p>When upgrading between patch versions (i.e between 0.13.0 and 0.13.2) it
should only be necessary to a db:migrate rake task. Using seek:upgrade
should still work, but could take a lot of unnecessary time.</p>

<h2 id="label-Steps+to+upgrade+from+0.14.x+to+0.15.x">Steps to upgrade from 0.14.x to 0.15.x</h2>

<p>SEEK 0.15 upgraded Rails to the latest 2 version,2.3.14. This requires an
update of Rubygems to 1.6.2. You can update rubygems directly by running</p>

<pre>gem update --system -v 1.6.2</pre>

<p>or install from scratch by reading the <a href="INSTALL.html">INSTALL</a>
guide. You can also use <a href="https://rvm.io/">RVM</a>. SEEK 0.15 also
runs fine on the latest Rubygems (currently 1.8.24) but you will get some
deprecation warnings. You can check you have the correct version of
rubygems by running</p>

<pre>gem -v</pre>

<p>Once Rubygems has been updated, the upgrade is the typical:</p>

<pre>RAILS_ENV=production ./script/delayed_job stop
bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:stop RAILS_ENV=production
hg pull https://sysmo-db.googlecode.com/hg/ -r v0.15.0
hg update
hg merge # only required if you've made changes since installing. If you have you may need to deal with conflicts.
hg commit -m &quot;merged&quot; # likewise - only required if you made changes since installing
bundle install --deployment
bundle exec rake seek:upgrade RAILS_ENV=production
bundle exec rake tmp:assets:clear RAILS_ENV=production
bundle exec rake tmp:clear RAILS_ENV=production

bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:start RAILS_ENV=production # to restart the search server
RAILS_ENV=production ./script/delayed_job start
touch tmp/restart.txt</pre>

<h2 id="label-Steps+to+upgrade+from+0.13.x+to+0.14.x">Steps to upgrade from 0.13.x to 0.14.x</h2>

<p>These are the fairly standard steps when upgrading between minor versions.
Note, the seek:upgrade task can take a while if there are many people and
assets in your SEEK, as it needs to populate some tables for the default
subscriptions (for email notifications).</p>

<pre>RAILS_ENV=production ./script/delayed_job stop
bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:stop RAILS_ENV=production
hg pull https://sysmo-db.googlecode.com/hg/ -r v0.14.1
hg update
hg merge # only required if you've made changes since installing. If you have you may need to deal with conflicts.
hg commit -m &quot;merged&quot; # likewise - only required if you made changes since installing
bundle install --deployment
bundle exec rake seek:upgrade RAILS_ENV=production
bundle exec rake tmp:assets:clear RAILS_ENV=production
bundle exec rake tmp:clear RAILS_ENV=production

bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:start RAILS_ENV=production # to restart the search server
RAILS_ENV=production ./script/delayed_job start
touch tmp/restart.txt</pre>

<h2 id="label-Steps+to+upgrade+from+0.11.x+to+0.13.x">Steps to upgrade from 0.11.x to 0.13.x</h2>

<p>There follows the commands required to upgrade. Anything after # are notes
and do not need to be included in the command run. There are a few
additional steps for this upgrade due to the switch from Solr to Sunspot as
the search system, and the introduction of Delayed Job for background
processing.</p>

<p>First there is an additionaldependency you will need, which on Ubuntu 10.04
or Debian can be installed with:</p>

<pre>sudo apt-get install libxslt-dev</pre>

<p>on Ubuntu 12.04 this will be:</p>

<pre>sudo apt-get install libxslt1-dev</pre>

<p>then the following steps will update the SEEK server:</p>

<pre>bundle exec rake solr:stop RAILS_ENV=production # this is specific to this upgrade, since the command to stop and start the search has changed.
hg pull https://sysmo-db.googlecode.com/hg/ -r v0.13.3
hg update
hg merge # only required if you've made changes since installing. If you have you may need to deal with conflicts.
hg commit -m &quot;merged&quot; # likewise - only required if you made changes since installing
bundle install --deployment
bundle exec rake seek:upgrade RAILS_ENV=production
bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:start RAILS_ENV=production # to restart the search server
bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:reindex RAILS_ENV=production  # to reindex
bundle exec rake tmp:assets:clear RAILS_ENV=production
bundle exec rake tmp:clear RAILS_ENV=production</pre>

<p>SEEK v0.13.x now uses a Ruby tool called <a
href="https://github.com/tobi/delayed_job">Delayed Job</a> to handle
background processing which now needs to be started using:</p>

<pre>RAILS_ENV=production ./script/delayed_job start</pre>

<p>And now SEEK should be ready to restart. If running together with Passenger
Phusion as described in the install guide this is simply a case of:</p>

<pre>touch tmp/restart.txt</pre>

<p>If you auto start solr with an init.d/ script - this will need updating to
reflect the change to sunspot:solr:start. The updated script should look
something like: <a
href="https://gist.github.com/3143434">gist.github.com/3143434</a></p>

<h2 id="label-Steps+to+upgrade+between+patches+%28e.g.+between+0.14.0+to+0.14.1%29">Steps to upgrade between patches (e.g. between 0.14.0 to 0.14.1)</h2>

<p>This should remain the same for all upgrades for minor bugfix patches,
unless we state otherwise. This example uses v0.14.1 as an example.</p>

<pre>hg pull https://sysmo-db.googlecode.com/hg/ -r v0.14.1
hg update
hg merge # if necessary
hg commit -m &quot;merged&quot; # if necessary
bundle install --deployment
bundle exec rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production
bundle exec rake tmp:assets:clear RAILS_ENV=production
bundle exec rake tmp:clear RAILS_ENV=production

RAILS_ENV=production ./script/delayed_job stop
RAILS_ENV=production ./script/delayed_job start

touch tmp/restart.txt</pre>
