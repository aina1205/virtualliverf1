      <h1>Installation</h1>
<p>
SEEK is based upon the Ruby on Rails platform. Although the information on
this page should provide you with everything you need to get a basic
installation of SEEK up and running, some background reading on Ruby on
Rails would be beneficial if it is new to you. Documentation and resources
describing Ruby on Rails can be found at <a
href="http://rubyonrails.org/documentation">rubyonrails.org/documentation</a>.
Since SEEK uses v2.3.8 of Rails, <a
href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/v2.3.8">guides.rubyonrails.org/v2.3.8</a>/
and <a
href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/v2.3.8">api.rubyonrails.org/v2.3.8</a> may
be useful as well.
</p>
<p>
We recommend that you run SEEK on a Linux system. All of the examples here
describe installing on an Ubuntu (10.04 LTS) or Debian system, but should
be easily transferrable to other Linux systems such as Fedora.
</p>
<p>
Although possible, installing and running Ruby on Rails on a Windows system
is troublesome and is not covered here.
</p>
<h2>Prerequesites</h2>
<p>
We recommend you use ruby, version 1.8.7.
</p>
<p>
MySQL server needs to be installed installed, along the development package
(required to compile the MySQL rubygem). We use the Ubuntu/Debian packages
<em>mysql-server</em> and <em>libmysqlclient15-dev</em>
</p>
<p>
The ImageMagick libraries need to be installed, as these are required by
the rmagic gem. We use the The Ubuntu/Debian package
<em>libmagick++9-dev</em>
</p>
<p>
You will need a minimal build environment, as some of the ruby gems require
compilation. The Ubuntu/Debian package <em>build-essentials</em> should be
sufficient
</p>
<p>
SEEK uses Lucene as its search engine, and this requires that java is
installed. We use the Sun Java 1.6 package <em>sun-java6-jdk</em>
</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b>If using Ubuntu, you will need to enable Partner sources to
install sun-java6-jdk . To do this edit <em>/etc/apt/sources.list</em> and
uncomment the lines so that they appear as follows:
</p>
<pre>
  ## This software is not part of Ubuntu, but is offered by Canonical and the
  ## respective vendors as a service to Ubuntu users.
  deb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu lucid partner
  deb-src http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu lucid partner
</pre>
<p>
(if you need more information, see <a
href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu#Adding+Canonical+Partner+Repositories">help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu#Adding+Canonical+Partner+Repositories</a>).
</p>
<p>
If you needed to add partner repositories, and its a good idea anyway, you
should now do an apt-get update and an apt-get upgrade to make sure things
are up to date:
</p>
<pre>
  sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get -y upgrade
</pre>
<p>
If using Ubuntu or Debian, the following commands should install most the
packages you need:
</p>
<pre>
  sudo apt-get install wget mercurial ruby rdoc ri libopenssl-ruby ruby-dev mysql-server libssl-dev build-essential openssh-server
  sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient16-dev libmagick++-dev libxml++2.6-dev sun-java6-jdk graphviz libsqlite3-dev sqlite3
</pre>
<p>
if you are intending to develop SEEK you will probably also want to use:
</p>
<pre>
  sudo apt-get install curl irb
</pre>
<p>
if setting up for production deployment using the <a
href="http://www.modrails.com/">Passenger Phusion (modrails)</a> module you
can save a step later by also using:
</p>
<pre>
  sudo apt-get install apache2-mpm-prefork apache2-prefork-dev libapr1-dev libaprutil1-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev
</pre>
<p>
You now need to install rubygems (1.3.7). Rather than install through
apt-get, we recommend downloading and installing from the rubygems website:
<a
href="http://rubygems.org/pages/download">rubygems.org/pages/download</a>.
The following commands should install rubygems for you on a Ubuntu/Debian
system.
</p>
<pre>
  cd /tmp
  wget http://production.cf.rubygems.org/rubygems/rubygems-1.3.7.tgz
  tar zfxv rubygems-1.3.7.tgz
  cd rubygems-1.3.7/
  sudo ruby ./setup.rb
  cd /usr/bin/
  sudo ln -s gem1.8 gem
  cd -
</pre>
<h2>Getting the source code</h2>
<p>
On a production server we would recommend installing into the directory
<em>/srv/rails/</em> and installing as the user www-data. There is also
more information later on how to setup Apache and <a
href="http://www.modrails.com/">Passenger Phusion (modrails)</a>.
</p>
<p>
Our source code is stored within the <a
href="http://code.google.com/p/sysmo-db/">Sysmo-DB Google Code
Repository</a>, using <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">Mercurial</a>
as the version control system.
</p>
<p>
For a stable version, you should check out according to a stable tag. Our
current stable tag is v1.0, so to retrieve this version you should use:
</p>
<pre>
  hg clone https://sysmo-db.googlecode.com/hg/ -r v1.0 seek
</pre>
<p>
<a href="http://gembundler.com/">Bundler</a> is used to manage gems, so to
install the required gems you first need to install the bundler gem:
</p>
<pre>
  gem install -d bundler rake
</pre>
<p>
Then from within the sysmo-seek directory run
</p>
<pre>
  bundle install
</pre>
<p>
If you are requested for a root or sudo password, but you do not have this
level of access then you should use
</p>
<pre>
  bundle install --deployment
</pre>
<h2>The RAILS_ENV environment variable</h2>
<p>
If you are setting up SEEK as a production environment, rather than for
development, you should set the RAILS_ENV variable before proceeding
</p>
<pre>
  export RAILS_ENV=production
</pre>
<h2>Rebranding SysMO SEEK for other projects</h2>
<p>
If you are running SEEK for a project other than SysMO, copy
config/initializers/seek_local.rb.pre to config/initializers/seek_local.rb.
This file contains several constants that you should set, to reflect the
name of your project/application.
</p>
<p>
To insert your application/project name into the help documents for SEEK,
and to remove the logos/links to SEEK&#8216;s &#8216;related projects and
friends&#8217; use
</p>
<pre>
  rake seek:rebrand
</pre>
<p>
If you only want to change the help documents, you can instead use
</p>
<pre>
  rake seek:rebrand_help_docs
</pre>
<h2>Configuring the database</h2>
<p>
Copy config/database.default.yml to config/database.yml and edit
accordingly - either MySQL or SQLite3 should work (you will need to install
the <em>sqlite3-dev</em> package and the <em>sqlite3-ruby</em> gem)
</p>
<p>
To add users to the MySQL database, first login to the database as an
administrator (root by default) and issue a GRANT command along the lines
of the example below (for clarity, this uses a username of
<em>mysqluser</em> and password <em>mysqlpassword</em>. <b>You are
obviously recommended to use a different username and password</b> on a
server exposed to the internet).
</p>
<pre>
    &gt; mysql -uroot -p
    Enter password:
    Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
    Your MySQL connection id is 1522
    Server version: 5.1.37-1ubuntu5.1 (Ubuntu)

    Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

    mysql&gt; CREATE USER 'mysqluser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'mysqlpassword';
    mysql&gt; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'mysqluser'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
</pre>
<p>
Run the rake database setup task, this creates the database, loads the
schema and seeds the database with any default data
</p>
<pre>
  rake db:setup
</pre>
<h2>A quick test</h2>
<p>
You can quickly check that everything is in order by running the system
tests as follows
</p>
<pre>
  rake db:test:prepare
  rake test
</pre>
<h2>Starting the server</h2>
<p>
You can now start the server with the command
</p>
<pre>
  ./script/server
</pre>
<p>
If running in production mode, you should start the server with
</p>
<pre>
  ./script/server -e production
</pre>
<h2>Creating the Admin user</h2>
<p>
Once the server is running you should visit the page <a
href="http://localhost:3000">localhost:3000</a>
</p>
<p>
If there are no users present in the system (and there should not be at
this stage) you will be requested to provide login details, and some basic
information about your profile (you can always come back and modify the
profile information and your password. You cannot modify your login name).
</p>
<p>
Once created this user will become the admin user of the system.
</p>
<h2>Administering the system</h2>
<p>
Once logged in as an administrator, you will notice a link on the
right-hand side of the tabs/search bar &quot;Admin Enabled&quot;. Selecting
this will provide you with some admin facilities for creating new projects,
institutions and profiles.
</p>
<p>
Here you can also define additional administrator users.
</p>
<h2>Setting up Passenger Phusion and Apache for production servers.</h2>
<p>
This section is only relevant if setting up a production deployment, and
assumes that seek has been deployed to /srv/rails/seek as the user
www-data, and that you have used RAILS_ENV=production whilst setting up.
Most of these steps are already very well documented at <a
href="http://www.modrails.com/install.html">Passenger Phusion Install
Guide</a> and the installation is a guided process.
</p>
<p>
If you have not done so already, then beforehand install some additional
libaries using:
</p>
<pre>
  sudo apt-get install apache2-mpm-prefork apache2-prefork-dev libapr1-dev libaprutil1-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev
</pre>
<p>
Next install the passenger gem
</p>
<pre>
  sudo gem install passenger
</pre>
<p>
Next run the following command to compile and install the modrails Apache
modules, and follow the instructions it provides
</p>
<pre>
  sudo passenger-install-apache2-module
</pre>
<p>
If you&#8216;ve followed the instructions, you will have added something
like the following (the version numbers may differ) to your
<em>/etc/apache/http.conf</em>
</p>
<pre>
  LoadModule passenger_module /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/passenger-3.0.7/ext/apache2/mod_passenger.so
  PassengerRoot /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/passenger-3.0.7
  PassengerRuby /usr/bin/ruby1.8
</pre>
<p>
and configured a virtual host that looks something like:
</p>
<pre>
  &lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
     ServerName www.yourhost.com
     DocumentRoot /srv/rails/seek/public
        &lt;Directory /srv/rails/seek/public&gt;
         AllowOverride all
         Options -MultiViews
      &lt;/Directory&gt;
   &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</pre>
