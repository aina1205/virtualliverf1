      <h1>Upgrading SEEK</h1>
<p>
<b>Always backup your SEEK data before starting to upgrade!!</b> - see the
<a href="BACKUPS.html">Backup Guide</a>.
</p>
<p>
This guide assumes that SEEK has been installed following the <a
href="INSTALL.html">Installation Guide</a> guide. It assumes it is a
production server that is being updated, and that commands are run from the
root directory of the SEEK application.
</p>
<p>
If your current installation is not linked to to the SEEK GoogleCode
mercurial repository, it can still easily be updated by taking the next
stable tag, reconfiguring the database configuration to point at your
existing database, and copying across the <em>filestore/</em> directory.
The upgrade steps can then be followed, with the Mercurial (hg) steps
omitted.
</p>
<h2>Identifying your version</h2>
<p>
You can tell which version you have installed by looking at the
<em>config/version.yml</em> file, so for example version 0.13.2 looks
something like:
</p>
<pre>
  major: 0
  minor: 13
  patch: 2
</pre>
<h2>General notes about versions and upgrading</h2>
<p>
<b>If upgrading from a version earlier than v0.11.x please contact our
GoogleGroup at <a
href="http://groups.google.com/group/seek-development">groups.google.com/group/seek-development</a></b>
</p>
<p>
When upgrading between versions greater than v0.11.x you need to upgrade to
each released version in order incrementally. The released versions are
listed below:
</p>
<ul>
<li>0.11.x

</li>
<li>0.13.2

</li>
<li>0.13.3

</li>
</ul>
<p>
<em>(Note there was no 0.12.x version released externally, this was an
internal release)</em>
</p>
<p>
Each version has a tag in mercurial that is the version preceeded by a
<em>v</em> - e.g. v0.11.1, v0.13.2
</p>
<p>
When upgrading between minor versions (i.e. from 0.11.x to 0.13.x) it is
necessary to run a seek:upgrade rake task to perform upgrade changes and
import any new data. The upgrade task may require an internet connection,
and sometimes can take some time to run, so please be patient.
</p>
<p>
When upgrading between patch versions (i.e between 0.13.0 and 0.13.2) it
should only be necessary to a db:migrate rake task. Using seek:upgrade
should still work, but could take a lot of unnecessary time.
</p>
<h2>Steps to upgrade from 0.11.x to 0.13.x</h2>
<p>
There follows the commands required to upgrade. Anything after # are notes
and do not need to be included in the command run. There are a few
additional steps for this upgrade due to the switch from Solr to Sunspot as
the search system, and the introduction of Delayed Job for background
processing.
</p>
<pre>
    rake solr:stop RAILS_ENV=production # this is specific to this upgrade, since the command to stop and start the search has changed.
    hg pull https://sysmo-db.googlecode.com/hg/ -r v0.13.3
    hg update
    hg merge # only required if you've made changes since installing. If you have you may need to deal with conflicts.
    hg commit -m &quot;merged&quot; # likewise - only required if you made changes since installing
    bundle install --deployment
    rake seek:upgrade RAILS_ENV=production
    rake sunspot:solr:start RAILS_ENV=production # to restart the search server
    rake sunspot:solr:reindex RAILS_ENV=production  # to reindex
    rake tmp:assets:clear RAILS_ENV=production
    rake tmp:clear RAILS_ENV=production
</pre>
<p>
SEEK v0.13.x now uses a Ruby tool called <a
href="https://github.com/tobi/delayed_job">Delayed Job</a> to handle
background processing which now needs to be started using:
</p>
<pre>
    RAILS_ENV=production ./script/delayed_job start
</pre>
<p>
And now SEEK should be ready to restart. If running together with Passenger
Phusion as described in the install guide this is simply a case of:
</p>
<pre>
   touch tmp/restart.txt
</pre>
<h2>Steps to upgrade between patches (e.g. between 0.13.2 and 0.13.3)</h2>
<p>
This should remain the same for all upgrades for minor bugfix patches,
unless we state otherwise. This example uses v0.13.2 as an example.
</p>
<pre>
  hg pull https://sysmo-db.googlecode.com/hg/ -r v0.13.3
  hg update
  hg merge # if necessary
  hg commit -m &quot;merged&quot; # if necessary
  bundle install --deployment
  rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production
  rake tmp:assets:clear RAILS_ENV=production
  rake tmp:clear RAILS_ENV=production

  RAILS_ENV=production ./script/delayed_job stop
  RAILS_ENV=production ./script/delayed_job start

  touch tmp/restart.txt
</pre>
