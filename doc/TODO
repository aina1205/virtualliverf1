Based partly on feedback from Carole:

- add more tagging and tag clouds, especially for expertise
- expand details displayed in lists
- Project descriptions - scrape from sysmo website
- make Project/Institution selection more dynamic using a series of drop down selection
- make more web2.0'y and less like looking over a database - single clicks between relationships
- make list items more like business cards

- split expertise - e.g. tools and organisms

- updated items page - new users, new assets etc

- make use of and display updated/created timestamp fields

- add footer with credits for myExperiment, and other credits in CREDITS file

- add a getting started text file - will be needed to help Sergy
- SOPs - just upload for now, but together with contribution model from myExperiment. Can get Sergy's help with this
