We recommend you use ruby, version 1.8.7 (though 1.8.6 should still work).

Make sure you have rubygems 1.3.5 installed. This may require downloading from the rubygems site, rather than relying on apt-get or rpm.

If using mysql you will need to install the mysql gem (gem install mysql) which requires the mysql dev libraries to be installed.

- Install the rmagic gem - gem install rmagick. This requires that ImageMagick or an equivalent is installed, along with the development libraries (probably libmagick++9-dev).
- Copy config/database.default.yml to config/database.yml and edit accordingly
- rake db:schema:load (preceded by rake db:create:all if the database doesn't already exist)
- make a copy of the config/initializers/seek_local.rb.pre to config/initializers/seek_local.rb (the default settings shouldn't need changing at this point).
- rake seek:refresh_controlled_vocabs - this prepopultes the database with a dummy user and a predefined list of tags assigned to them
- To start, run script/server

if using search

- in the config/initializers/seek_local.rb file , set "SOLR_ENABLED=true"
- make sure the directories "vendor/plugins/acts_as_solr/solr/logs" and "vendor/plugins/acts_as_solr/solr/tmp" exist
- rake solr:start to start database server
-. rake solr:reindex to reindex any existing data

defining admin users

There is no support for this in the interface.
You need to:
- connect to the database using script/console,
- find the User that you wish to make an admin (note User, not Person, if you know the Person you can do person.user)
- set the is_admin flag to true. Don't forget to 'user.save!'.
