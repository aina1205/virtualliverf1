We recommend you use ruby-1.8.6, we have found problems using 1.8.7 that we are looking into.

Make sure you have rubygems 1.3.1 installed. This may require downloading from the rubygems site, rather than relying on apt-get or rpm.

If using mysql you will need to install the mysql gem (gem install mysql) which requires the mysql dev libraries to be installed.

1. Install the rmagic gem - gem install rmagick. This requires that ImageMagick or an equivalent is installed, along with the development libraries (probably libmagick++9-dev).
2. Copy config/database.default.yml to config/database.yml and edit accordingly
3. rake db:migrate (preceded by rake db:create:all if the database doesn't already exist)
4. rake seek:repop_cv - this prepopultes the database with a dummy user and a predefined list of tags assigned to them
5. To start, run script/server

if using search

5. make a config/environment_local.rb file, and add to it "SOLR_ENABLED=true"
6. make sure the directories "vendor/plugins/acts_as_solr/solr/logs" and "vendor/plugins/acts_as_solr/solr/tmp" exist
7. rake solr:start to start database server
8. rake solr:resolr to reindex any existing data
